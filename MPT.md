## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### The alternative finance protocol for real-world assets (RWAs) tokenization to ensure secure and compliant processes for both primary and secondary token issuance, at everyone's fingertips.

#### Description

Marco Polo Technologies (MPT) stands as a pioneering entity in the web3 space of infrastructure solutions, dedicated to disrupt alternative finance, financial instruments and mechanisms. Our primary objective centers around facilitating seamless interactions within private markets and alternative investments. MPT is designed to align with global regulatory standards, emphasizes investor protection, enforces rigorous KYC/AML/KYB protocols, and implements mechanisms to deter market manipulation. Alongside our commitment to security and compliance, we are building an intuitive user interface (UI) architecture, which enables businesses, especially those less familiar with technology, to effortlessly create alternative finance platforms using a streamlined drag-and-drop interface.

MPT assists businesses in  reaching untapped markets by connecting real-world assets with a diverse range of investors and finance experts. By fostering collaborations between asset owners, investors, and issuers, we aim to revolutionize the landscape of alternative finance and bridge the gap between traditional finance, DeFi, and the latest web3 technologies. Our primary aim is to channel more investments from traditional and private sectors into the digital web3 realm, fostering more inclusive, liquid and transparent markets for all participants.

#### Marco Polo Technologies, Substrate and Polkadot - A brief description of our project.

At Marco Polo Technologies, we have constructed the foundational layer of our infrastructure using *Rust* and opted for *Substrate* as our blockchain development framework. This decision enables us to integrate a blockchain layer tailored specifically for the primary and secondary token issuance of real-world assets. As dedicated practitioners, we persistently work with modern frameworks to democratize access for all investor classes and help unlock previously unreachable markets. By crafting our alternative finance protocol for real-world assets on *Substrate* and seamlessly integrating it with our existing infrastructure, Marco Polo Technologies aims to share and create the following benefits with the Polkadot ecosystem:

- Financial Inclusivity: We are on a mission to streamline onboarding by leveraging our unique social network to connect with reliable clientele, thereby expanding the digital private markets' reach to a broader spectrum of investors and asset owners.
- Asset Interoperability: Our integration will ensure effortless transfers and trades of real-world assets across the Polkadot network, expanding liquidity and accessibility for all participants.
- Expanding market access: We provide a gateway for diverse participants to delve into private markets and real-world asset issuance, enriching the Polkadot ecosystem's financial landscape.
- Fostering DeFi innovation: We actively incorporate real-world assets within the decentralized finance space, reinforcing potential DeFi applications like fractional ownership, collateralization, and asset-backed lending, to attract new clients and assets to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Building a robust ecosystem: We add a strategic financial component to augment the inherent infrastructure of Polkadot, attracting a wider range of platforms and users and diversifying its applications.
- Blockchain Synergy: We emphasize the support for diverse real-world assets and guarantee seamless trading and investment opportunities throughout the network.
- Wallet Compatibility: Our protocol is geared towards aligning with various wallets within the Polkadot ecosystem, simplifying the procedures of buying, storing, and exchanging real-world assets for every investor class.

#### Team interest

Comprising a compact yet seasoned group of practitioners and professionals, our team boasts expertise in alternative finance, venture investing, and technology. Our journey has organically steered us towards supporting the growth of private markets. The current phase of our project is motivated by our ambition to tokenize real-world assets, which enables fractional ownership representation and trading opportunities, thereby dismantling long-standing challenges like illiquidity and restricted access for non-institutional investors. We are eager to capitalize on the advantages of transparency, immutability, automated compliance, and accurate ownership records by utilizing the advanced technologies of *Substrate* and *Polkadot*. By doing so, we aim to foster trust and eliminate obstacles in the alternative finance sector, making it more approachable and enticing for a broader spectrum of investors and asset proprietors.

### Project Details

Our primary objective is to design a comprehensive alternative finance protocol, serving as a foundational blueprint to validate and onboard real-world assets (RWAs) to the blockchain, and share its benefits with market participants that have had no access to it so far. We are focusing on bridging the traditional finance sector with the emerging decentralized finance ecosystem and central to our approach is the versatile pallet we are developing, designed to tackle the unique challenges and requirements of the global alternative finance landscape. Together, our protocol, pallet, and features will ensure that alternative finance platforms can seamlessly integrate, harnessing advanced features for RWAs and beyond. We are currently designing and developing the following features:

1) Unified protocol design: leveraging the *Substrate* framework, our company aims to introduce a comprehensive alternative finance protocol tailored specifically for RWAs. Our vision is to develop a protocol that transcends traditional asset tokenization, facilitating seamless primary and secondary issuance of RWAs. We are committed to simplifying both the onboarding and tracking of these assets, striving to provide an optimized experience for all clients.
2) Advanced token mechanics: our protocol will present an innovative and efficient token standard, designed to challenge traditional financial processes, supporting asset owners to directly tokenize their RWAs with ease, while simultaneously offering investors and managers an environment for investing and trading, leveraging alternative finance in the digital space.
3) Asset storage and exchange: we are adding an array of functions to our infrastructure aimed at streamlining the custody and management of RWAs. Clients and finance managers can confidently store and effortlessly trade their tokenized assets, capitalizing on our clients platforms' dynamic environments and a vast set of financial instruments.

The image below represents the two layers of our infrastructure and how we started using the _Substrate_ layer to support all sorts of alternative finance platform implementations.

Among the diverse work of our team members, here are some platforms that have been built and deployed in the past decade, clients vary from boutique advisory firms to publicly traded companies:

- [Professional investment network](https://www.kobofunds.com/) built on the current infrastructure
- [Global impact investment platform](https://www.convergence.finance/)
- [APT Systems - Spera coin project](https://www.sperastablecoin.com/)
- Real estate platforms: [1](https://www.capitalrise.com/), [2](https://yielders.co.uk/), [3](https://www.galliardhomes.com/), [4](https://www.shojin.co.uk/)

### Ecosystem Fit

Marco Polo Technologies is building an *all-in-one* hub for private markets participants to develop and launch alternative finance platforms and tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), applying the core principles of security, transparency, and compliance to accelerate the adoption of modern finance frameworks in web3. We focus on building finance and operations specific modules and are naturally blending into the *Substrate* and *Polkadot* ecosystems, aiming at leveraging the interoperability between different blockchains, which is essential for the seamless transfer and trading of RWAs across different chains, as well as the flexibility offered by the *Substrate* framework to develop an alternative finance focused blockchain.

We are aware of other projects in the *Substrate* and the *Polkadot* ecosystems that are working in complimentary areas, such as Centrifuge and Polymesh; and while they entered the DeFi market in pursuit of liquidity or by building a platform focused for institutional investors, our approach follows the opposite logic in the attempt to capture liquidity and assets in the alternative and private markets segments, that are mostly off-chain. We have implemented a unique social network that leverages existing communities and real-life relationships, such approach not only allows us to access a wider customer base but also enables our clients to onboard pre-vetted assets from trusted actors onto our platforms. Furthermore, the social network aspect empowers our clients to add trusted and reliable participants to enhance their clients' offerings while ensuring scalability for users.

Our infrastructure is designed to be used by technology teams and by less tech-savvy users, to serve private markets participants (family offices, VCs, PEs, financial managers, retail investors, etc.) and organizations that intend to tokenize and create alternative financing solutions for their businesses; connecting previously undeserved assets with private liquidity providers, attempting to revolutionize the way private markets operate by making them more accessible, liquid and inclusive.

### Team's experience

Our team has a vast and diverse experience across various industry segments and modern technologies and has been able to go from the initial conceptualization of market needs in the private financial sector, to the delivery of a compliant and flexible infrastructure. Our intent has been that of creating building blocks with functions and modules that can be easily assembled to create all sorts of alternative finance platforms, to support the transition of traditionally or off-line ran businesses to the adoption of a fintech focused web3 infrastructure, for private businesses transacting and operating in private markets, enlarging the concept of *sophisticated investors* to continuously push the boundaries of a legal framework that does not keep up with a modern financial infrastructure.

The team combined experience spaces from software architecture and development in Rust, C/C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, SQL, mathematical algorithms, mobile and web development, content parsing and filtering, to the recent exploration of WebAssembly and Substrate. Moreover, our team is able to manage and implement complex projects, navigating regulatory requirements and financial processes, to be applied on business cases focused on private markets, as some of the examples shown above. More in particular, we aim at being the choice for other technology teams interested to implement their alternative finance solutions with our vast array of workflows, as well as being the platform of choice for existing businesses that have no technological resources or skills. 

### Team Code Repos

MPT is a private project and its repositories are kept private, we have shared links to some of our current and previous projects within this application.

We will be providing and updating an _ad hoc_ repository in the context of the current grant application.

## Future Plans

We are committed to developing a secure, compliant, and user-friendly infrastructure that redefines private market financing and operations for everyone.

In the short term, we plan to develop more features and products for our tokenization layer. In addition to primary and secondary issuance of assets, we will enable the creation of ETFs-like and portfolios of assets in private markets accessible to all investor classes.

On more practical terms, we are also embracing a new project for a primary and secondary issuance platform to connect private and institutional investors to growing SMEs wanting to expand in emerging markets, where financial infrastructure is lacking. Finally, we will further advance our KYC/KYB/AML capabilities to provide on-chain verified info, as well as exploring the best route to integrate *off-chain workers* for data verification.

In the long term, we aim to become the go-to parachain for alternative finance products for private companies in the *Polkadot* environment, focusing on creating and implementing more complex financial products and services, as well as taking into account the legal and regulatory implications of developing and deploying decentralized financial applications.
