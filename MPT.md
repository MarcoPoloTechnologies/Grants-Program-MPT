## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### The alternative finance protocol for real-world assets (RWAs) to securely and compliantly automate primary and secondary token issuance.

#### Description

Marco Polo Technologies (MPT) is an infrastructure company that provides the foundational elements for alternative finance platforms, instruments, and mechanisms, with a focus on serving participants in private markets. Our modular and secure infrastructure supports global policymakers' priorities, such as investor protection and KYC/AML/KYB requirements, while preventing market manipulation. We are also developing a user-friendly UI architecture to enable non-tech-savvy clients to rapidly create alternative finance platforms through an intuitive *drag-and-drop* experience.

MPT infrastructure enables businesses to expand into under served markets by connecting real-world assets to any investor class and finance managers. Our ongoing efforts harness the synergy between asset owners, investors, and issuers to facilitate transformative changes in the alternative finance markets, turning them into public-like, friction-less models. MPT bridges the gap between traditional finance, DeFi, and modern web3 infrastructure needed to support the flow of new liquidity from private and offline markets to web3, while increasing the transparency, accessibility, and inclusivity of digital private investments.

#### Marco Polo Technologies, Substrate and Polkadot - A brief description of our project.

Our first layer of the infrastructure is built with *Rust*, and we chose *Substrate* as our development framework as a natural addition to our existing technology, to add a blockchain layer that focuses on the primary and secondary issuance of tokens representing real-world assets (RWAs), while enabling access to all investor classes and enabling access to previously unaccesible markets. By building an alternative finance protocol for RWAs on *Substrate* and connecting it with our comprehensive infrastructure, Marco Polo Technologies (MPT) aims to share the following benefits with the Polkadot ecosystem:

- Promoting financial inclusion on platforms: on-boarding reliable clients through established social connections, making digital private markets more accessible to a wider range of investors and asset owners, leveraging our proprietary social network.
- Enhancing asset interoperability: by enabling the seamless transfer and trading of RWAs across the Polkadot network, new liquidity and accessibility for all market participants is enabled.
- Expanding market access: providing a gateway for a diverse range of participants to access private markets and RWAs issuance and trading, enriching the Polkadot ecosystem's financial landscape.
- Fostering DeFi innovation: leveraging RWAs within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, supporting existing possibilities for DeFi applications such as fractional ownership, collateralization, and asset-backed lending, to attract new clients and assets to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Building a robust ecosystem: adding a layer of financial functionality that complements and strengthens the overall infrastructure of Polkadot, to attract more platforms and clients to the ecosystem and expand its use cases.
- Interoperability with other blockchains: supporting a variety of RWAs and facilitate easy trading and investments across the network.
- Wallet support: our protocol will be interoperable with other wallets in the Polkadot ecosystem, supporting various fiat currencies, to simplify how users can buy, store and exchange their RWAs.

#### Team interest

Our team is a small, senior, and resourceful group with expertise in alternative finance, venture investing, and technology. Our project has naturally evolved towards supporting the development of private markets and our current iteration is driven by our goal of tokenizing RWAs, which allows for fractional ownership representation and exchanges, while breaking down historical barriers such as illiquidity and limited access for non-institutional investors. We aim to harness the benefits of transparency, immutability, automated compliance and ownership records by leveraging *Substrate* and *Polkadot*'s robust technologies. These benefits instill trust and reduce friction within the alternative finance market, making it more accessible and appealing to a wider range of investors and asset owners.

### Project Details

Our intention is to deliver an initial implementation of an alternative finance protocol, starting with asset tokenization, to support the build out of platforms on top of our infrastructure. Our first steps for the MVP of this project would be to:

1) Set up our alternative finance focused blockchain and develop its initial attributes: specifically designed for issuance, representation and trading of RWAs, whereas primary issuance would be the focus in the initial phase.
2) Set up the initial role of the tokens for primary and secondary issuance through smart contracts: creating a token standard that will make it swift for asset owners to issue tokens that represent their RWAs, and allow investors to invest in and trade the tokens.
3) Set up the initial wallet functions to allow for interaction with multiple users owning multiple assets: we aim at implementing a wallet that will allow users to store and manage their RWAs.

The image below represents the two layers of our infrastructure and how we would be using the _Substrate_ layer to support all sorts of alternative finance platform implementations.

Among the diverse work of our team members, here are some platforms that have been built and deployed in the past decade, clients vary from boutique advisory firms to publicly traded companies:

- [Professional investment network](https://www.kobofunds.com/) built on the current infrastructure
- [Global impact investment platform](https://www.convergence.finance/)
- [APT Systems - Spera coin project](https://www.sperastablecoin.com/)
- Real estate platforms: [1](https://www.capitalrise.com/), [2](https://yielders.co.uk/), [3](https://www.galliardhomes.com/), [4](https://www.shojin.co.uk/)

### Ecosystem Fit

Marco Polo Technologies is building a one-stop shop for private markets participants to develop and launch alternative finance platforms and tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), applying the core principles of security, transparency, and compliance to accelerate the adoption of modern finance frameworks in web3. We focus on building finance and operations specific modules and are naturally blending into the *Substrate* and *Polkadot* ecosystems, aiming at leveraging the interoperability between different blockchains, which is essential for the seamless transfer and trading of RWAs across different chains, as well as the flexibility offered by the *Substrate* framework to develop an alternative finance focused blockchain.

We are aware of other projects in the *Substrate* and the *Polkadot* ecosystems that are working in complimentary areas, such as Centrifuge and Polymesh; and while they entered the DeFi market in pursuit of liquidity or by building a platform focused for institutional investors, our approach follows the opposite logic in the attempt to capture liquidity and assets in the alternative and private markets segments, that are mostly off-chain. We have implemented a unique social network that leverages existing communities and real-life relationships, such approach not only allows us to access a wider customer base but also enables our clients to onboard pre-vetted assets from trusted actors onto our platforms. Furthermore, the social network aspect empowers our clients to add trusted and reliable participants to enhance their clients' offerings while ensuring scalability for users.

Our infrastructure is designed to be used by technology teams or by less tech-savvy users, to serve private markets participants (family offices, VCs, PEs, financial managers, etc.) and companies that intend to tokenize and create alternative financing solutions for their businesses; connecting previously undeserved assets with private liquidity providers, attempting to revolutionize the way private markets operate by making them more accessible, liquid and inclusive.

### Team's experience

Our team has a vast and diverse experience across various industry segments and modern technologies and has been able to go from the initial conceptualization of market needs in the private financial sector, to the delivery of a compliant and flexible infrastructure. Our intent has been that of creating building blocks with functions and modules that can be easily assembled to create all sorts of alternative finance platforms, to support the transition of traditionally or off-line ran businesses to the adoption of a fintech focused web3 infrastructure, for private businesses transacting and operating in private markets, enlarging the concept of *sophisticated investors* to continuously push the boundaries of a legal framework that does not keep up with a modern financial infrastructure.

The team combined experience spaces from software architecture and development in Rust, C/C++, Python, C#, JavaScript, SQL, mathematical algorithms, mobile and web development, content parsing and filtering, to the recent exploration of WebAssembly and Substrate. Moreover, our team is able to manage and implement complex projects, navigating regulatory requirements and financial processes, to be applied on business cases focused on private markets, as some of the examples shown above. More in particular, we aim at being the choice for other technology teams interested to implement their alternative finance solutions with our pre-built workflows. 

### Team Code Repos

MPT is a private project and its repositories are kept private, we have shared links to some of our current and previous projects within this application.

We will be providing and updating an _ad hoc_ repository in the context of the current grant application.

## Development Status :open_book:

Here you can find documentation on the research and our preliminary conversation with a Parity team member: [MPT market research](MPT_market_research.pdf) and [Reference of previous conversation with Parity](Parity_Marco_Polo_preliminary.pdf).

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

Our team is working on the creation and implementation of other finance products and mechanisms, as well as compliance aspects,  in the wider context of our infrastructure development that are to be intended outside of this grant application. We would have the equivalent of 2.5 people, cumulatively, contributing full-time to this project and the language of development would be *Rust*.

The below roadmap refers to an initial implementation of a purposely built blockchain for alternative finance generic functions using *Substrate*.

## Future Plans

We are committed to developing a secure, compliant, and user-friendly infrastructure that has the potential to revolutionize the way that private markets are financed and operated.

In the short term, we plan to develop more features and products for our tokenization layer. In addition to primary and secondary issuance of assets, we will enable the creation of ETFs-like and portfolios of assets in private markets accessible to all investor classes.

On more practical terms, we are also embracing a new project for a primary and secondary issuance platform to connect private and institutional investors to growing SMEs wanting to expand in emerging markets, where financial infrastructure is lacking. Finally, we will further advance our KYC/KYB/AML capabilities to provide on-chain verified info, as well as exploring the best route to integrate *oracles* for on and off chain data verification.

In the long term, we aim to become the go-to parachain for alternative finance products, private companies, and digital private markets in the *Polkadot* environment.
